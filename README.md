# GroupMate
Make happy teams with ease... 

# About the Project
This is an app to help teachers and anyone who needs to form groups to make teams that maximize minimum happiness. The app takes in a CSV file that can be created from our linked Google Form and randomly sorts people into groups based on parameters such as the number of people you want in a group and the preferences of the people in the class. The app also has the functionality to freeze members in specific groups if you're happy with certain team placements. We have included a template for a Google Form that you can send to students to fill out and is compatible with our app.
